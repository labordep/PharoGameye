## Tips

### How to get Collectibles with a database synchronization problem ?

Since v5 of GAMEYE application there is a country / region management. 

A problem can appears when GAMEYE application not recognize your collectible: each collectible is displayed with a "red title".

You need to fix each collectible by selected the good one in the list, but this is difficult to get all "red title" collectibles, especially on a big database.

A way to identify collectibles is to use this script on your collection :

```smalltalk
"get your collection manually with the sample file"
collection := GameyeCollectionFactory createOwnedCollectionFromExportedSpreadsheet: 'pharo-local\iceberg\labordep\PharoGameye\GameyeSpreadsheetSampleV5.csv' asFileReference.
games := collection videoGamesForCountry: nil. "here games are a list of games with potential problems, no one in the sample"
```

Or use ```GameyeExamples``` script to import into the Pharo UI :

Note : this problem was present in v4 but without way to identify wich collectibles are with a problem.
